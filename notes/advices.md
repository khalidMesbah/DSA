# Advices

- master a programming language (c++ is recommended)
- know the big o notation
- memorize the patterns
- think twice code once
- difficulty is relative
- a problem is all about
- start with easy then, medium, and hard
- think on paper not on pc
  - sketch a solution
  - verify the solution
  - ask yourself, is there a more efficient way
  - think of the problem from a different angle
- don't move on from a problem until you understand it and it's solution
- focus on improving your thought process
- focus on the fundamentals
- learn and understand a DSA problem in way that makes you able to teach it in an easy way
  - you should be able to understand a problem very well and explain it in an easy manner
- memorize
  - patterns
  - important algorithms (DFS) (Core Algorithms: e.g. sliding window)
- problem solving is all about pattern recognition
- add the most repeated functions to the `Arsenal`
