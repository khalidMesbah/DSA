# Physical VS Logical Views of Data Structures

## Physical View

- physical view: how data is stored in memory
- examples:
  - array
  - linked list
  - vector
- all logical data structures are built on top of physical data structures (arrays, linked lists )
- there are two physical views of a data structure
  - array: consecutive memory locations
  - linked list: scattered memory locations

## Logical View

- logical view: how data is represented in code
- any data structure of a physical view can is at its basic level a logical view
- examples:
  - 2d array
  - stack
  - queue
  - tree
  - graph
  - trie
