# Misc

- A self referential data structure is essentially a structure definition which includes at least one member that is a pointer to the structure of its own kind.
- associative array = map
- array = a fixed buffer in memory/ a fixed memory region
- in dynamic programming we're solving optimization problems
- backtracking is not for optimization problems
- backtracking is used when you have multiple solutions and you want all those solutions
- backtracking follows brute force approach
- the solution is in the form of a state-space tree
