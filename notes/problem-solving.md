# Problem solving

- it's about detecting the patterns
- a problem is an idea
- focus on questions by topic and don't solve random questions to be able to recognize the pattern
- order the questions from the highest to lowest acceptance rate
- learn from the solutions and understand it
- revisit problems

> If i hand an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions
>
> If you don't understand the problem well enough, all solutions are useless
